### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Virginia
  
- ðŸ“ˆ I worked with Pula Capital Management as a Data Science Intern between January and April 2024. I developed a 1+1 Dconvolutional neural network to predict the day-to-day direction of SPY index prices by capturing patterns in individual stocks and across the S&P 500. I developed models on PyTorch Lightning with Optuna/TensorBoard, employing early-stopping, gradient clipping, and hyperparameter tuning to ensure model convergence and generalizability. I showcased my methodologies to firm executives with a final presentation.

- ðŸ”­ I worked with the UVA Biocomplexity Institute's Social and Decision Analytics Division as a Data Science Research Assistant and Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Intern. Between my 2022 summer internship and my ongoing research, I have worked on these three projects with the Biocomplexity Institute:
    -  Mastercard: Social Impact Data Commons for DMV Region (R) (https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/sdc.intro/)
        - ETL, data wrangling, automated testing, 
    -  USDA: Evaluating Broadband Subsidy Programs (R) (www.github.com/DSPG-Young-Scholars-Program/dspg22ers/)
        - linear regressions, t-tests, spatial analysis with GIS, presenting to stakeholders at USDA
    -  NCSES: Emerging Trends in Government R&D Funding (Python) (www.github.com/DSPG-Young-Scholars-Program/dspg22RnD/)
        - Supervised machine learning, NLP, document vectorization, topic models, presenting to stakeholders at NCSES
 
- Below are some class projects I have completed during my M.S. Data Science program
    -  Predicting California Precipitation Levels (M.S. Data Science Capstone project, https://github.com/mtvaden1/California_Climate_Capstone)
        - Convolutional Neural Networks, PyTorch, TensorFlow
    -  Predicting Algerian Forest Fires (for Bayesian Machine Learning final project, https://github.com/mtvaden1/Algeria_Forest_Fires_DS6040)
        - Bayesian machine learning, hierarchical models
    -  Applying Tidymodels to Spam Filtering (for Statistical Learning final project, https://github.com/mtvaden1/DS6030_TidyModels_Final_Project)
        - Tidymodels, machine learning, educational guide
    -  Die-Game: Imitating an n-sided die, playing games, and analyzing results (for Programming for Data Science final project, https://github.com/kristianolsson23/die_game_DS6001)
        - Python classes and objects
