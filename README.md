### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Virginia

- ðŸ”­ I worked with the UVA Biocomplexity Institute's Social and Decision Analytics Division as a Data Science Research Assistant and Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Intern. Between my 2022 summer internship and my ongoing research, I have worked on these three projects with the Biocomplexity Institute:
    -  Mastercard: Social Impact Data Commons for DMV Region (R) (https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/sdc.intro/)
    -  USDA: Evaluating Broadband Subsidy Programs (R) (www.github.com/DSPG-Young-Scholars-Program/dspg22ers/)
    -  NCSES: Emerging Trends in Government R&D Funding (Python) (www.github.com/DSPG-Young-Scholars-Program/dspg22RnD/)
 
- Below are some class projects I have completed during my M.S. Data Science program
    -  Predicting California Precipitation Levels (M.S. Data Science Capstone project, https://github.com/mtvaden1/California_Climate_Capstone)
        - Convolutional Neural Networks
    -  Predicting Algerian Forest Fires (for Bayesian Machine Learning final project, https://github.com/mtvaden1/Algeria_Forest_Fires_DS6040)
    -  Applying Tidymodels to Spam Filtering (for Statistical Learning final project, https://github.com/mtvaden1/DS6030_TidyModels_Final_Project)
    -  Die-Game: Imitating an n-sided die, playing games, and analyzing results (for Programming for Data Science final project, https://github.com/kristianolsson23/die_game_DS6001)
